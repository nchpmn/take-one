        <p>You know the worst thing about being a slave? They make you work, but they don't pay you or let you go. And I'm his friend Jesus. No, I'm Santa Claus! Would you censor the Venus de Venus just because you can see her spewers? You can see how I lived before I met you. Wow, you got that off the Internet? In my day, the Internet was only used to download pornography.</p>
<p>Spare me your space age technobabble, Attila the Hun! I don't know what you did, Fry, but once again, you screwed up! Now all the planets are gonna start cracking wise about our mamas.

That is why I am your king. Be quiet!</p>
<p>Ah, now we see the violence inherent in the system! Bring her forward! Well, she turned me into a newt. I am your king. Burn her anyway! It's only a model.</p>
